# Purpose of this course

- **Understand program evaluation as a _consumer_**  
  - Synthesize and understand evaluation results  
  - Evaluate the quality of policy evaluations or choose between evaluation proposals  
  - Make evidence-based decisions  
- **Provide skills to design and implement program evaluations**  
  - Many economists work on evaluations, not only in academia

---

# Why do we evaluate programs?

- **Policy** and **program** will be used as synonyms  
- Lots of money is spent every year to try to change things:  
  - Government-provided job training programs  
  - Sugar-tax to reduce obesity  
  - Subsidies to increase R&D investment in firms  
  - Incentive schemes to increase worker productivity  
- We want to know:  
  - What difference have these programs made?  
  - What outcomes have been affected? By how much and for whom?

---

# Broader agenda: Evidence-based policy making

- Policy decisions informed by rigorously established evidence  
  - In reality often: _Policy-based evidence making_  
- Based on the idea of evidence-based medicine  
- Goal: Inform allocation of resources, guide policy decisions, enhance accountability  
- Build general knowledge about the effectiveness of policies  

---

# Which policies should we evaluate?

- Evaluations are costly, especially data collection  
- What are the stakes of this policy?  
  - Budget  
  - Size of target population  
  - _Potential_ effect sizes  
- Evaluate if the policy is:  
  - Innovative: new and promising  
  - Replicable: can be scaled up or applied in a different setting  
  - Strategically relevant: flagship initiative, requires substantial resources, could have large (side) effects or generate substantial savings  
  - Untested: Little is known about the effectiveness of this type of policy  
  - Influential: Results will be used to inform key policy decisions  

---

# Common errors

- People without knowledge in program evaluation tend to confuse:  
  - Monitoring and evaluation  
  - Correlation and impacts  
- Examples:  
  - "The program was successful: 72% of participants find a job after job training"  
  - "I feel better today because I took Globuli yesterday"  
  - "She has a high income because she studied economics"  
  - "Aztecs: Without human sacrifices of children, rain would not come, and crops would not flourish"  
- This can be extremely misleading

# Simpson's (1951) paradox

- Event C increases the probability of E in the population, whereas it decreases the probability of E in all sub-populations  
- Example: Taking a particular pill is helpful for the population but harmful for men and women

| Combined         | Recovery (E) | Not E | Sum | Recovery Rate |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ----- | --- | ------------- |
| Drug (C)         | 20           | 20    | 40  | 50%           |
| No drug (not C)  | 16           | 24    | 40  | 40%           |

# What is impact evaluation?

- **Monitoring** tracks what is happening with a program, looks at the program implementation  
  - Is the money indeed spent the way it was supposed to be?  
- **Impact evaluations** seek to answer a cause-and-effect question  
  - Which changes are directly attributable to a program?  
  - What is the effect of obtaining a university degree on earnings?

---

# Prospective versus retrospective evaluation

- **Prospective evaluation**  
  - Set up at the same time as policy  
  - Built into policy implementation/roll-out  
- **Retrospective evaluation**  
  - Policy evaluation after implementation  
- PE is more likely to produce credible evaluation results  
  - (Baseline) data collection on treated and controls  
  - Creates focus on policy objectives  
  - Easier to construct credible counterfactual  

---

# Efficacy studies and effectiveness studies

- **Efficacy studies**  
  - Carried out in a specific setting under closely controlled conditions  
  - Small-scale pilot/proof of concept  
- **Effectiveness studies**  
  - Interventions that take place in normal circumstances, using regular implementation channels  
  - Aim to produce findings that can be generalized to a large population  

---

# Internal versus external validity

- **Internal validity**  
  - Evaluation identifies causal effect of program in a given setting  
  - Varying degrees of credibility (RCT: Gold Standard)  
- **External validity**  
  - Generalizability of causal effect to other situations  
  - Informative for a larger or different population, different time  

---

# Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis

- **Cost-benefit analysis**  
  - Estimates the total expected benefits of a program, compared to its total expected costs.  
  - Seeks to quantify all of the costs and benefits of a program in monetary terms and assesses whether benefits outweigh costs.  
- **Cost-effectiveness analysis**  
  - Compares the relative cost of two or more programs or program alternatives in reaching a common outcome  
Impact evaluation estimates the benefit side, and cost analysis provides the cost information! We focus on **impact evaluation**.

---

# Preparing for an evaluation

- Specify the evaluation question  
- Construct a theory of change  
- Develop a results chain  
- Select indicators to assess performance

---

# Evaluation question

- First step: Formulate a clear study question  
  - What is the impact of the policy on an outcome of interest?  
  - Which changes are directly attributable to a program?  
- Needs to be framed as a **well-defined, testable hypothesis**

---

# Are these good evaluation questions?

- What is the effect of studying economics on later earnings?  
- What is the effect of being a woman on the likelihood of becoming a politician?  
- What is the effect of reducing the speed limit on highways from 130 to 100 km/h on the number of traffic deaths?

---

# Theory of change

- Describe the causal pathway (sequence of events from policy to final outcomes)  
- Formulate necessary assumptions and enabling conditions  
- Include all stakeholders  
- Consult existing literature  

---

# Results chain

![Results chain](figures/results_chain)

---

# Results chain - example

- Government agency provides training about settlement to immigrants  
  - **Inputs**: Staff from government agency, trainers, facilities, government budget, contact information of immigrants  
  - **Activities**: Design curriculum of training, select and prepare trainers, design, prepare, and distribute written material  
  - **Outputs**: Number of immigrants trained, number of written materials provided  
  - **Outcomes**: Immigrants behave differently based on information provided  
  - **Final outcomes**: Immigrants are (economically) more successful, higher well-being, less welfare spending for immigrants, reduced social tensions  

---

# Performance indicators (Outcomes)

- Ideally use indicators along the whole results chain  
  - Not only final outcomes  
  - Understand mechanisms  
  - Especially important if evaluation finds no effect on final outcome  
- Selection of indicators should involve stakeholders  
- SMART indicators  
  - **Specific**: Translates required information into operational measure  
  - **Measurable**: Information can be measured and obtained  
  - **Attributable**: Indicator is linked to the policy's efforts  
  - **Realistic**: Information can be obtained timely, with reasonable frequency, at reasonable cost  
  - **Targeted**: To the objective population
