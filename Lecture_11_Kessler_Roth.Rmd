## Difference-in-Differences

- Today we'll be going over Kessler & Roth (2014) and seeing how they do DID
- This is the same paper used as a coding example in the textbook
- There's nothing particularly special about this paper - it's not groundbreaking or famous
- But it's just a good example of how DID works in action

## Discussion 1

- What is the theoretical background of why they're studying this?
- Why do they think that an observational study might do a *better* job than the experiments in this case?
- What has the previous literature found?

## Discussion 2

- How do they set up their DID? How do they define treatment *and control*?
- What assumptions do they focus on and how do they justify them?
- What causal diagram might they have in mind?

## Discussion 3

- What do they find?
- How can we interpret each column of Table 2?
- Is there anything else they should have done?
- How do they make sense of their results in the conclusion?
